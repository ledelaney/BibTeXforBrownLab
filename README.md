Hey, friends! This repo contains some instructions and example files to get you started using Zotero and LaTeX for your manuscripts. I know that these tools can seem ovewhelming, but the effort it takes to learn them is well worth the benefit: you really don't need to worry about formatting bibliographies or citations ever again. What if the journal you are submitting to wants a different citation style? No problem! Just change the style in your LaTeX file and re-knit your PDF. Easy-peasy.

Here is how I recommend you use this tutorial:

1. Clone the repo by clicking the green `Code` button above and selecting "Download Zip file"
2. In the `Instructions` folder, you'll find a PDF outlining all the steps to set up the software on your computer and use it. (I also included the raw TeX file used to generate the instructions, if you want to know how the sausage was made, so to speak.)
3. In the `ExampleFiles` folder, you'll find two different files depending on whether or not you are writing a manuscript with citations or doing a straight bibliography with no text.

Email me if you have any questions!
